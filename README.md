# RE:Gate

#### A pretty simple Flask-based web application that was able to solve a **real** problem my friend had these last few days!

---

## 1. The Motivation

  * A problem one of my friends had some days ago.
    He studies Cinema here in my country, and one of his homeworks for this semester was called Dadaist Horoscope.
    The task was to develop something that:
       1. Was related to randomness
       2. Could be seen more than once

    And then, this project begun

## 2. The Project

  * The project consists in a Web Application based on what was taught to me in the Web Track

    Users are able to register themselves, log in, and interact with the database in some restricted ways.
    They can create new "gates" (witch are basically Hexadecimal ID's stored in the _gates_ table) and add URLs to them. When such "gates" are created,
    the user can reach them via a GET Request and the app will redirect them to a random link from one of those registered and associated with that "gate".

## 3. The Result

  * Even though It's a simple application, It was able to solve someone's problem, and I'm very happy about this :)
    Thanks to everyone in the CS50 team for making such a wonderful content, I really enjoyed this experience!
